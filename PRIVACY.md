## Data Collection and Usage
Labelo does not collect, store, or share any personal data. The app operates solely on the CoreNFC framework provided by Apple, which allows the app to interact with Near Field Communication (NFC) tags in a secure and private manner.

NFC functionality: The app uses CoreNFC to scan NFC tags. It does not access or store any data from the tags unless explicitly shared by the user within the app (e.g., displaying text from the NFC tag).
No user data collection: Labelo does not request, collect, or store any personal information such as names, email addresses, or other identifiers.

## CoreNFC Framework
The CoreNFC framework is a standard framework provided by Apple that allows iOS devices to read NFC tags. This functionality is limited to interacting with physical NFC tags and does not involve collecting any information beyond what is explicitly provided by the NFC tag itself.

## Third-Party Services
Labelo does not use any third-party services or analytics tools that collect personal data or track user activity. The app does not display advertisements, and it does not integrate with any external platforms that would require the collection of personal information.

## Data Security
As we do not collect or store any personal data, there are no data security risks associated with personal information. However, it is important to note that interactions with NFC tags are handled securely according to Apple's guidelines, ensuring that data from the tags is processed only locally on your device.

## Your Privacy Rights
Since Labelo does not collect any personal data, there are no privacy-related rights (such as access or deletion requests) that need to be exercised. You are in full control of any data shared through the app, such as manually entering data into the app from NFC tags.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. Any significant changes to the privacy practices will be communicated to you in the app. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.
